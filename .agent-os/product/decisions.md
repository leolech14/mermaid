## 2025-07-26: Architecture for Stability

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer

### Decision

Adopt a strict modular architecture with clear boundaries between components to prevent the cascading failures experienced in previous versions. Each module must be self-contained with explicit interfaces.

### Context

Previous attempts at building this editor failed due to tightly coupled code where small UI changes would break core functionality. The lack of clear module boundaries led to orphan files, confusion, and ultimately unusable code.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic single-file approach**
   - Pros: Simple initial development
   - Cons: Unmaintainable, prone to breaking

2. **Microservices architecture**
   - Pros: Maximum isolation
   - Cons: Overkill for a client-side application

### Rationale

A modular architecture provides the right balance of isolation and simplicity, allowing for safe modifications to individual features without affecting the entire system.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Isolated failures - bugs don't cascade
- Easier testing of individual modules
- Clear code organization

**Negative:**
- Initial setup complexity
- Need for careful interface design

## 2025-07-26: Single-File Distribution Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer/User

### Decision

The application must be distributable as a single HTML file containing all code, styles, and assets, while maintaining a modular development structure.

### Context

The requirement for easy distribution and usage from any browser/device necessitates a single-file approach. However, development must remain modular to maintain code quality.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional web app with CDN**
   - Pros: Smaller initial load
   - Cons: Requires hosting, internet connection

2. **Desktop application**
   - Pros: Better performance
   - Cons: Platform-specific, installation required

### Rationale

A single HTML file provides maximum portability and ease of use while Vite's build process can bundle modular code into this format.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero-friction distribution
- Works offline
- No hosting costs

**Negative:**
- Larger file size (target: <500KB)
- Build process complexity

## 2025-07-26: Vanilla JavaScript Over Frameworks

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer

### Decision

Use vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) instead of frameworks like React or Vue to maintain full control over the rendering pipeline and minimize bundle size.

### Context

The visual canvas editor requires precise control over rendering and performance. Frameworks add abstraction layers that can interfere with custom canvas operations and increase bundle size.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **React**
   - Pros: Component ecosystem, familiar patterns
   - Cons: Virtual DOM overhead, larger bundle

2. **Svelte**
   - Pros: Compile-time optimization
   - Cons: Learning curve, less control

### Rationale

Vanilla JS provides the performance and control needed for a canvas-based editor while keeping the bundle size minimal for single-file distribution.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Full control over performance
- Minimal bundle size
- No framework lock-in

**Negative:**
- More boilerplate code
- Need to implement own patterns

## 2025-07-26: Development Standards for Error Prevention

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Developer

### Decision

Establish strict development standards including mandatory error boundaries, comprehensive testing before integration, and prohibition of untested "quick fixes."

### Context

Previous versions broke due to hasty modifications and lack of testing. A disciplined approach is needed to maintain stability.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Rapid prototyping approach**
   - Pros: Faster initial development
   - Cons: Accumulates technical debt quickly

2. **Formal TDD only**
   - Pros: High quality code
   - Cons: Slower for experimental features

### Rationale

A balanced approach with mandatory error handling and testing for core features, while allowing some flexibility for experimental features in isolated modules.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Stable, maintainable codebase
- Confidence in making changes
- Clear development workflow

**Negative:**
- Slower initial development
- More upfront planning required

## 2025-07-26: Canvas-First, Code-Second Architecture

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Developer/User

### Decision

The visual canvas is the primary interface, with code editing as a synchronized secondary view. All features must work visually first, with code generation following.

### Context

The goal is to create a tool where visual thinking comes first, differentiating from traditional code-first Mermaid editors.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Code-first with visual preview**
   - Pros: Easier to implement
   - Cons: Doesn't achieve the vision

2. **Separate modes**
   - Pros: Simpler state management
   - Cons: Loses the seamless integration benefit

### Rationale

A canvas-first approach aligns with the product vision of merging art and knowledge while maintaining the precision of code.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unique user experience
- Intuitive for visual thinkers
- Enables artistic expression

**Negative:**
- Complex synchronization logic
- Challenging edge cases
