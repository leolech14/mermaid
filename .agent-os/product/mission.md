## Pitch

Mermaid Canvas Editor is a visual diagram creation tool that helps creative developers transform ideas into beautiful, interactive diagrams by providing both code editing and direct visual manipulation with extensive styling options for colors, shapes, animations, and effects.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Solo Developer/Creator**: Individual developer who needs to create beautiful technical diagrams for documentation, learning, and knowledge sharing

### User Personas

**Technical Creative** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Developer/Technical Architect/Knowledge Worker
- **Context:** Creates diagrams for system design, documentation, and knowledge visualization
- **Pain Points:** Limited styling options in standard tools, disconnect between code and visual editing, need to switch between multiple tools
- **Goals:** Create visually stunning diagrams efficiently, maintain both precision and aesthetics, work in a single unified environment

## The Problem

### Fragmented Diagram Creation Experience

Current diagramming tools force users to choose between code-based precision or visual editing flexibility. Users lose hours switching between tools, manually adjusting positions, and recreating work when minor changes break entire layouts.

**Our Solution:** Unified canvas editor that synchronizes code and visual editing in real-time.

### Limited Artistic Expression

Technical diagrams are often bland and uniform, limiting the ability to create visually compelling knowledge artifacts. Standard tools offer minimal customization for colors, shapes, animations, or visual effects.

**Our Solution:** Extensive styling system with animations, glass morphism effects, and unlimited customization options.

### Complex Deployment and Sharing

Most diagram tools require installations, accounts, or complex hosting setups. Sharing interactive diagrams involves multiple steps and often loses interactivity.

**Our Solution:** Single HTML file that runs anywhere, containing the entire application and diagram data.

## Differentiators

### True Hybrid Editing

Unlike tools that offer either code OR visual editing, we provide simultaneous synchronized editing where changes in code immediately reflect visually and vice versa. This results in 10x faster diagram creation with pixel-perfect precision.

### Artistic Canvas System

We treat diagrams as works of art, not just technical drawings. Our nested canvas system, X-ray vision, and extensive styling options enable creation of multi-layered, animated diagrams that tell stories visually.

### Zero-Friction Distribution

Our single-file HTML approach means diagrams can be shared via email, USB, or any file transfer method. Recipients need only a web browser - no installations, accounts, or internet connection required.
